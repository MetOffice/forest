# FOREST - Forecast and Observation Research and Evaluation Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/informatics-lab/forest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/informatics-lab/forest)

This repository hosts the code to visualise forecast model output and observation data in a web portal, as well as the scripts and configuration files to deploy the server infrastructure.


## Installation

At present installation is a simple case of cloning this repository. The
setup.py and conda-spec.txt are intended to make it easier to build the
package inside a virtual environment.

Currently there is work taking place to deploy FOREST with conda, but this
has yet to be finalised.

## Documentation

Please read the [docs](https://forest-informaticslab.readthedocs.io), they
should address all of the most common issues, frequently asked questions, developer
guides, tutorials, api references. They are a work in progress but should
quickly become an invaluable resource over time.
