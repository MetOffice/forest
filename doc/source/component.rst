Build a component
-----------------

Components are objects that talk to the :class:`forest.redux.Store`,
they come in many flavours but the most common components
create bokeh widgets, connect events to actions and render themselves
on state change.

   - React to state changes
   - Send actions to middleware/reducers via ``store.dispatch``
