Developer guide
===============

Contributing to FOREST should be simple. Building, testing and documenting
the code should be as easy as falling off a log, pardon the pun.

To get ideas on how to contribute, first take a look at
the existing issues_ list. If an
issue exists that you would like to work on, go ahead and
assign yourself to it or drop a comment so that one of our
developers can get in touch. 

Alternatively, if there are no issues that address
your need open a new issue that describes the feature or bug you
are thinking about. A well written issue will make it easy for other
developers to help you, review your changes or even point out similar
functionality that may already be being worked on elsewhere.

The issue list is organised into projects_. Projects help us
prioritise which issues should to be tackled next. It's a good
idea to take a peak at the currently active project to see
what is considered urgent and what is deemed less of a priority.
