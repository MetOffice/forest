# A helper script to run forest on a local machine.
# usage: run_forest_dev /path/to/data/ 6001
# inputs:
# * /path/to/data - location of data to be used by forest, usually a local
#                   mount of the s3 bucket
# * 6001 -a port number on the dev machine
# notes: if you have run the forest_setup script, you will need to ensure
# you have updated your $PATH to point at the correct version of conda
# and python, and activated the relevant conda env.


# this script expects to be run from the root directory of a local clone of
# the forest repository.
